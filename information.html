<h3 class="informationparagraph">In recent decades, human activity has significantly altered Earth's natural systems—often at an accelerating pace. One of the most pressing changes is climate change, driven largely by the burning of fossil fuels, which releases large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This has led to rising global temperatures, more extreme weather events, and melting glaciers and polar ice.
<br>
<br>
Deforestation, particularly in tropical regions like the Amazon, has reduced biodiversity and disrupted carbon and water cycles. At the same time, urbanization and industrial development have expanded, leading to increased air and water pollution, soil degradation, and habitat loss for many species.
<br>
<br>
The oceans have also felt the impact. Overfishing, plastic pollution, and warming waters are harming marine ecosystems, while coral reefs are dying off due to bleaching caused by heat stress.
<br>
<br>
Even the atmosphere and biodiversity are shifting. Many species are now endangered or extinct due to habitat destruction, pollution, and invasive species introduced by global trade and travel.
<br>
<br>
While these environmental changes are alarming, they have also sparked a global response-greater awareness, innovations in clean energy, conservation efforts, and international cooperation aimed at protecting the planet for future generations.</h3>

    Burning Fossil Fuels
(Leads to air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change)

Deforestation
(Causes habitat loss, increased CO₂ levels, and reduced biodiversity)

Plastic Pollution
(Harms wildlife, contaminates oceans, and enters the food chain)

Industrial Agriculture
(Leads to soil degradation, water pollution, and high emissions)

Overfishing
(Disrupts marine ecosystems and reduces fish populations)

Water Pollution
(Contaminates drinking water and harms aquatic life)

Urban Sprawl & Habitat Destruction
(Destroys natural areas and contributes to climate and biodiversity loss) -->
